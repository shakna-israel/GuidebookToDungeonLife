# Guidebook to Dungeon Life

---

This is a simple adventure game intended to run in the browser, across any device, and to run well (which is somewhat of a pipe dream).

## The Story

The world has adventurers, brave heroes who venture deep into dungeons in the hopes of riches and glory, with the ultimate goal of one day conquering a dungeon.

You are not an adventurer.

You are a researcher, who got it into their head that it might be a good idea to write down what these adventurers are doing, or doing wrong.

## Lua!? I thought this was for the browser!

Is is.

But I despise working with JS. It turns the simplest of things into an exercise with frustration. Maybe I just prefer correctness too much.

Lua, whilst just as dynamic as JS, produces fewer attempts to get you to shoot your own foot off.

Fengari is a Lua VM in JS, and is relatively fast. It also runs in everything from IE11 upwards, and can interface with JS in a relatively seamless, but intelligent, way that embraces the Lua way of doing things.
